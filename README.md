# cpts451-Yelp-customer-and-business-query-application

Overview:
In 2013, Yelp.com has announced the “Yelp Dataset Challenge” and invited students to use this data in an innovative way and break ground in research. In your project you would query this dataset to extract useful information for local businesses and individual users.
The Yelp data is available in JSON format. The original Yelp dataset includes and 5.2M reviews by 1.3M users for 174K businesses from United States, Canada, UK, and Germany. (https://www.yelp.com/dataset) In your project you will use a smaller dataset that your instructor created. This simplified dataset includes only 11,481 businesses, 192,999 users, and 416,490 reviews written for those businesses.
You will be given sample code (Python) to parse some of the Yelp JSON files (available on Blackboard). The Yelp JSON files that you will use in this project are available at the instructor’s website at:

(Note: Please make sure to use the dataset available on the above link, not the one from the Yelp.com website)
See Appendix-B for an overview of the Yelp Academic Dataset.

Requirements:
You would develop a target application which runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful information. The primary users for this application will be potential customers seeking for businesses.
Using this application the users can gather information about:
the businesses in a particular state, city, and/or zipcode,
the businesses that belong to certain categories,
detailed information about a business,
ratings and popularity of businesses,
etc.
You may design your application either as a standalone or a web-based application.
